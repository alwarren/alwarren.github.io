Sit back and enjoy a few random thoughts and musings from an old guy with a computer. The journey is about to begin. It's going to be a fun ride my friend.

In six million? Perhaps the answer lies in this old house in this old and misty valley..." - The Outer Limits, 1963*

Just some old guy with a computer that says he's paid his dues in I.T. Claims he did a lot of COBOL back in the day. Whatever that means. Now days, he does this stuff as a hobby to keep his mind sharp.

He's a pretty nice guy that really enjoys learning and sharing what he learns with others.

It's called Aleph. It's a cursive form of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Here's an interesting bit of trivia about Aleph. If you reverse it, the bits and pieces form a new meaning - wonder. As if by magic. In fact, that's where the word *abracadabra* comes from. It's Hebrew for, *"I create as I speak."* It has nothing to do with the site other than it looks cool.

>Kindness is one of the greatest gifts you can bestow upon another.
<br/>If someone is in need, lend them a helping hand. Do not wait for a thank you.
<br/>True kindness lies within the act of giving without the expectation of something in return.
